Getting your page titles right is difficult. Nuxt SEO helps you by providing a fallback title and a default title template.

## Page Meta Title

Normally you would need to use `useHead` or `useSeoMeta` to set your page title.

Nuxt SEO also gives you the option to add a title using [page meta](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-page-meta) instead.

```vue twoslash [pages/index.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { definePageMeta } from '#imports'

definePageMeta({
  title: 'My Page Title'
})
</script>
```

Note: You can only provide simple strings using page meta.

## Fallback Title

Ensures that every page has a title by generating one from the last slug segment.

For example, if your page is `/blog/my-awesome-post`, the title will be `My Awesome Post`.

This is useful for when you have a lot of pages and don't want to manually set a title for each one
or if you simply forget to set a title.

To disable this feature:

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  seo: {
    fallbackTitle: false
  }
})
```

## Default Title Template

Sets a default title template for you with your [site name](/site-config/guides/setting-site-config).

See the [Title Templates](/nuxt-seo/guides/title-templates) guide for more information.
