title: Redirect To Canonical
description: The default meta tags Nuxt SEO sets for you.
---

It's common to have multiple domains or subdomains pointing to the same content. For example,
supporting a `www.` and non-`www.` domain.

This can cause [duplicate content issues](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en),
Nuxt SEO helps you with this by adding a [default canonical URL](/nuxt-seo/guides/default-meta).

However, you may want to additionally redirect to the canonical URL to ensure that all traffic
is going to the same place.

This redirect is optional and disabled by default.

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  seo: {
    redirectToCanonicalSiteUrl: true
  }
})
```
